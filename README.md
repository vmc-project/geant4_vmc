# Geant4 VMC

Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) defines a detector simulation framework that allows to run different simulation Monte Carlo without changing the user code and therefore the input and output format as well as the geometry and detector response definition.

[Geant4 VMC](https://vmc-project.github.io/user-guide/geant4_vmc) implements the Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) interface for [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/).

It also includes the [G4Root](https://vmc-project.github.io/user-guide/g4root) package, which is independent from Geant4 VMC and can be build and used stand-alone, and [VMC Examples](https://vmc-project.github.io/user-guide/vmc-examples), that can also be built independently and do not require Geant4 installation in case you want to run them with GEANT3.
