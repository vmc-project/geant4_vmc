  11/02/2016
  v3-2-p1:
    Patch release, including following fixes:
    Geant4 VMC:
      - Fix in transforming primaries from TParticle to G4PrimaryParticle:
        - From Oliver Freyermuth (University of Bonn)
          do not override the user defined mass with the PDG mass
      - Fix in TG4ParticlesManager::CreateDynamicParticle(TParticle*):
        the particle polarization was not propagated from TParticle to Geant4;
        this affected the particles added to tracking by the user via stackPopper
      - Fixed deleting TG4SpecialControlsV2 instance in MT mode
    Examples:
      - In E06: fixed in cloning MCApplication on workers

    Tested with Geant4 10.01.p02 (with embedded CLHEP 2.2.0.4)
      Root 5.34/26 and Root 6.04/02, VGM 4.3

  17/08/2015
  v3-2:
    Geant4 VMC:
    - Added support for local magnetic fields.
    - Added cached magnetic field and a related UI command :
        /mcMagneticField/setConstDistance value unit
      The cached magnetic field is created automatically when
      the ConstDistance parameter is set to a non zero value.
    - Added a possibility to include a user defined magnetic field equation of motion 
      and its integrator
    - Integrated a new special UrbanMsc model adapted for ALICE EMCAL by V. Ivantchenko
      and introduced a new set of commands (which do not allow invalid configurations):
        /mcPhysics/emModel/setEmModel modelName
        /mcPhysics/emModel/setParticles particleName1 particleName2 ...
        /mcPhysics/emModel/setRegions regionName1 regionName2 ...

    Examples:
    - E03: Added a test configuration for including a user defined magnetic field equation 
           of motion and its integrator in example E03 and included the test in test suites
    - E06: Added test for adding tracks in VMC stack by user (in E06 example)
    - A01: Implemented option for use of local magnetic field and
           added a test with use of local fields in test suites

    Fixes:
    Geant4 VMC:
    - Fixed TG4StackPopper class handling adding particles on the stack
      from the user application. The user tracks generated at the last step of parent track
      were not popped to the stack.
    - Fixed implementation of TVirtualMC::IsTrackDisappeared():
      return false if fSuspend, true if fStopAndKill.
    - Use G4PAIPhotModel instead of G4PAIPhotonModel (recommended since Geant4 10.00)
    - Fixed the expected names of output-files from rootcint (required by CMake 3.2.x):
      - thanks to Oliver Freyermuth (Physics Institute of the University of Bonn).

    G4Root (A. Gheata):
      Fixed boundary crossing errors (by A. Gheata)
      -  This error was due to the G4 field propagator which was exiting
         some volume inside the mother and expecting a non-zero step, but in fact
         was entering a daughter volume right away.
      This fixes killing tracks by G4PropagatorInField as:
      *** G4Exception : GeomNav1002
              issued by : G4PropagatorInField::ComputeStep()
      Particle is stuck; it will be killed.
          Zero progress for 51 attempted steps.
          Proposed Step is 1.78471e-05 but Step Taken is 1.78471e-05
         in volume TPC_Drift
      *** This is just a warning message. ***

    Known problems:
    - On MAC OSX, a build option for Root VMC library has to be activated
      for running in MT mode
      o At present, this requires a customised ROOT installation with a
        modification of TMCtls.h in root/montecarlo/vmc/include

    Tested with Geant4 10.01.p02 (with embedded CLHEP 2.2.0.4)

    - The range cut calculated per region for electron is now by default applied
      also to positron and proton
    - Implemented commands which allow to inactivate applying range cuts
      per particle:
      /mcRegions/applyForXYZ true|false  where XYZ=Gamma, Electron,Positron,Proton
    - Added a command for setting the range cut for proton:
      /mcPhysics/rangeCutForProton
    - Implemented commands to reduce Geant4 output from Geant4 hadronics physics:
      /mcPhysics/g4NeutronHPVerbose
      /mcPhysics/g4HadronicProcessStoreVerbose

    Known problems:
    - The problems listed in v3-0 (related to MT only)  are remaining.
    - test_suite_exe.sh fails for example A01 (during loading geometry from a file)
      with Root 6.02/02 - the problem requires a fix in Root

    Examples:
    - Separated macros for loading libraries (load_g3|4.C) from run macros
       (run_g3|4.C) - required for cling (Root6)
    - Improved examples test suites:
       o Possibility to select g3/g4 test via arguments
       o Added summary message and return code
       o Possibility to define build dir via arguments

    Fixes:
    - Fixed optional compilation without Geant4 G3toG4 package

    - Problem at exit in E02 example in MT mode
    - On MAC OSX, a build option for Root VMC library has to be activated
      for running in MT mode
      o At present, this requires a customised ROOT installation with a
        modification of TMCtls.h in root/montecarlo/vmc/include

    Aknowledgment:
     Thanks to Oliver Freyermuth, Physics Institute of the University of Bonn
     for testing CMake build and examples test suites and his contributions.

    - Fixed compiler warnings issued with Geant4 compiler flags not
      enabled by default (mainly shadowed variables)

    Tested with Geant4 10.00 (with embedded CLHEP 2.1.4.1)
      + patch provided at http://bugzilla-geant4.kek.jp/show_bug.cgi?id=1537, 
      Root 5.34/13, VGM 3.06

  14/12/2012
  v2-14:
    Migration to Geant4 9.6
    Geant4 VMC:
    Developments:    
    - Implemented commands for activating saving random number status
      and restoring it from a file: 
    - Improved TG4VSpecialCuts: reorganized code to avoid unnecessary 
      calculations before tests

      user can now introduce chargedgeantino by setting the title 
      "ChargedRootino" to Rootino particle.
    - Fixed bug in TVirtualMC::Gdtom() implementation 
    - Fixed units in stacking particles 
    - Fix in TVirtualMC::GetSecondary implementation: get track global time 
      instead of the local one
    - Fixes to support Geant4 native geometries: handling copyNo, taking into 
      account the user limits 
    - Fixed units in material optical properties  
 
    Examples:
    - Added new A01 example
    - Improved g4vis.in macros and removed use of gean4_vmc commands 
      (now removed)
    - In E02, E03: Default physics list changed to FTFP_BERT to be consistent 
      with the examples in Geant4 9.6
 
    Tested with Geant4 9.6 (with embedded CLHEP 2.1.3.1), 
      Root 5.34/03, VGM 3.06


  13/12/2011
  v2-13:
    Migration to Geant4 9.5:
    In Makefiles: use of geant4-config if G4INSTALL is not defined
    
    Geant4 VMC:
    Developments:
    - Implemented a possibility to select sensitive volumes by the user;
      in this case TVirtualMCApplication::Stepping() function is called only when
      track is located in a sensitive volume.
    - Added the user physics selection in the TGeant4 title, so that
      it can be retrievable in a user application.
    - Migration to changes in G4PhysListFactory
      (now all hadronic lists can be combined with all EM options)
    - Modified building of physics list:
      Added TG4ExtraPhysicsList with the following optional Geant4 builders:
      G4ExtraPhysics   -  moved from TG4EmPhysicsList;
      G4OpticalPhysics -  which has replaced TG4OpticalPhysics;
        this implies the changes of commands for configuring optical processes
      G4RadioactiveDecayBuilder - new
    - Faster implementation of TVirtualMC::GetMediumID()
      (the medium ID is now added in TG4SensitiveDetector object)

    Fixes:
    - Fix in GetSecondary(..) (bug reported by L. Zambelli) 
      there was missing conversion of units in the returned value of particle 
      momentum.
    - Fixing compilation with G4UI_NONE and G4VIS_NONE

    Examples:
    - new g4libs.C macro with use of geant4-config;
      the macro based on liblist renamed to g4libs_old.C;
      previous g4libs_old.C (explicit loading) removed
    - E06:
      - Added setting parameters for Optical Mie Scattering (according N06)  
      - Updated configuration optical processes using G4 commands
      - Removed special setting for G3 (it was causing G4 exception
        and seems not to be needed for G3)
    
    Tested with Geant4 9.5 (with embedded CLHEP 2.1.1.0), 
      Root 5.30/04 and Root 5.32/00 + patch in root/etc from rev.42474,
      VGM 3.05

  14/07/2011

    Migration to Root v5.30/00 and Geant4 9.5.b01
    
    Geant4 VMC:
    Developments:
    - Implemented new TVirtualMC functions:
      Bool_t GetMaterial(Int_t imat, ...);
      ... which replaced the current Gfmate(...) functions
    - Mapping physics processes from 9.4.p02 
    - Adding light anti-ions (ani_deuteron, anti_triton, anti_alpha, anti_He3) 
      so that users do not to define them themselves via 
      TVirtualMC::DefineParticle.

    Fixes:
    - Coverity defects
    - Fix in TG4ParticlesManager for handling particles which have 
      no equivalent in TDatabasePDG: the particle is now added in TDatabasePDG 
      without issuing an exception

    Examples:
    - Adding a test for testing all available G4 physics lists
    - Adding a test for the new function GetMaterial() in E01
    - Removing code calling Geant3 visualization functions from all 
      examples code and macros
    - Adding a primary generator with anti_nuclei in E03 and added this test 
      in test_suite
    
    Tested with Geant4 9.4.p02 and 9.5.b01, CLHEP 2.1.0.1, 
      Root 5.28/00e and Root 5.30/00, VGM 3.04

    Tested with Geant4 9.4, CLHEP 2.1.0.1, Root 5.28/00, VGM 3.04

  02/10/2010
  v2-10:
    Geant4 VMC:
    Improvements:
    - Implemented new TVirtualMC functions:
      virtual void   SetCollectTracks(...);
      virtual Bool_t IsCollectTracks() const;
      virtual Bool_t CurrentBoundaryNormal(...) const;
   - Added new TG4EmModelPhysics which allows user selection of an extra 
      EM energy loss and fluctuations models.
   -  Adding a utility class, TG4ParticlesChecker, for comparing particles 
      properties defined in Root and Geant4 and its messenger 
      TG4ParticlesCheckerMessenger.
    - Implemented commands to allow user to customise the setting of the 
      the max allowed step in materials with a density below a limit value
    - Added a possbility to switch off passing the random number seed from 
      TRandom in CLHEP::HepRandom; this allows using standard Geant4 commands 
      for saving and restoring the random number generator status
    - Mapped processed used in CHIPS and QBBC physics lists   
    - Migration to Geant4 9.4.b01:
      - updated TG4UserParticlesPhysics, mapped processes present in new 

    Fixes:
    - Fixed the time of flight returned via TVirtualMC::TrackPosition():
      return the global track time (= time since the event in which the track 
      belongs is created) instead of local track time (= the local time since 
      the current track is created) in order to be consistent with Geant3.
    
    Tested with Geant4 9.3.p02, CLHEP 2.0.4.5, Root 5.27/06, VGM 3.03
            and Geant4 9.4.b01, CLHEP 2.0.4.6  

    Examples:

    G4Root
      - Moved from Root in Geant4 VMC 
      
    Geant4 VMC:
    Improvements:
      - Added new class TG4FieldParameters which allows customization of Geant4
        magnetic field integrator and accuracy parameters.
        (See E02/g4config.in an example of new commands.)
      - Added new class TG4CrossSectionManager which allows inspecting
        hadronic cross sections. 
        (See: http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/physics-list)
      - The available hadron physics lists names are now taken directly from
        G4PhysListFactory.   
        
    Fixes:
      - In TG4RegionsManager: 
        - set the range cuts to result always to an energy cut below the user 
          cut value.
        - set ranges also for the world volume
        - increased the maximum order of search ranges (to 1km) 
        - fixed CheckCut method (the cut from range must be <= VMC cut)
      - In TG4StepManager:
        - Adding its own G4Navigator object, which is used for LocateGlobalPoint... 
          calls in pre-track phase.
          (Fixes the problem reported by A. Robert.)
      - In TG4OpGeometryManager, TG4OpticalPhysics 
        - Do not set RINDEX material property if defined with zero values.
          (The zero value is a Geant3 convention to define material as metal 
          which was not adopted in Geant4, where 0 values cause unpredictable 
          behavior in G4OpBoundary process.)
        - The Raileigh and boundary processes were not added to opticalphoton 
          process manager.
      - Fix in applying MCApplication::TrackingRMax,TrackingZMax.  
      
    Examples:
      - Frozen testing examples with Fluka.

  21/01/2010
  v2-8:
    Geant4 VMC:
    Improvements:
       - In optical physics:
         Implemented new command for user customization
         of optical physics list;
         Changed/added the default parameters:
           fgkDefaultMaxNumPhotons = 20; 
           fgkDefaultMaxBetaChange = 1.0; 
           fgkDefaultYieldFactor = 1.0;  
       - Passing the random number seed from TRandom in CLHEP::HepRandom
         (on the request from FairRoot)
       - Added an option to print memory usage at the end of event
       - Added an option to print all regions 
       - New, faster implementation of VMC functions:
           Int_t VolId(const Text_t* volName) const;
           const char* VolName(Int_t id) const;
    
    Fixes:
      - Fixes in applying VMC cuts:
        - fixed processes names in TG4G3CutVector
        - fix in applying PPCUTM: the cut is now applied as a limit
          to the total energy of e+e- pair procuced by muon; 
          the cut is not applied for e+e- pair from gamma conversion
      - Fix in handling feedback photons: keep the feedback photon 
          PDG encoding which is different from opticalphoton
      - Fix in applying max step limit
      - Fix in TG4RunConfiguration constructor:
          to handle correctly special physics options.
          Thanks to M. Al-Turany for reporting this problem.
      - Fixes for running with option G4UI_NONE
          Thanks to V. Di Benedetto for reporting this problem.
      - Fixed handling of particle weights
          Thanks to Vito Di Benedetto for pointing at this.
          
    Tested with Geant4 9.3, CLHEP 2.0.4.5, Root 5.26/00, VGM 3.02;

    Examples:
       - Added an example of magnetic field class Ex02MagField in E02
         
    Tested with Geant3 1.11, Geant4 VMC 2.8, Fluka VMC 0.4 
             

  15/07/2009
  v2-7:
    Geant4 VMC:
      - Implemented new TVirtualMC function:
        virtual void SetUserParameters(Bool_t isUserParameters);
        which allows to activate the parameters defined in tracking media
        (DEEMAX, STMIN, STEMAX), which are, be default, ignored.
        In Geant4 case, only STEMAX is taken into account.
      - New implementation of VMC cuts via regions;
        this limits the number of secondaries produced beyond
        tracking cuts and speeds up simulation.
      - New implementation of support for special controls (G3 flags):
        The process TG4SpecialControls is replaced with a manager class
        TG4SpecialControlsV2, which functions are colled from tracking
        and stepping functions.
      - When using special stacking action, neutrinos are not killed 
        by default, but optionally. This options can be set via a command:
        /mcTracking/skipNeutrino  [true|false]
       Fixes:
      - Fix in applying special controls (the original processes activation
        was not always restored when particle got out from a given tracking 
        medium or stopped).
      - Fix in applying SetMaxStep (the original step limit was not always 
        restored when particle got out from a given tracking 
        medium or stopped). 

     Tested with Geant4 9.2.p01, CLHEP 2.0.4.2, Root 5.24/00, VGM 3.02;

   Examples:
      - Fixes in E02 example: fixing a problem reported by A, Robert,
        when using stack for a large events, links to mother particles
        get lost after a few hundreds of events.
 
     Tested with Geant3 1.11, Geant4 VMC 2.7, Fluka VMC 0.4 

  06/03/2009
  v2-6:
    Geant4 VMC:
       - Adaptation to the new TGeo mag field interface
       - Implemented TVirtualMC::SetUserDecay
