  v6-3:
    Geant4 VMC:
      Improvements and fixes in VMC cuts to ranges conversion (#43)
      - Added new functions in TG4RegionsManager for saving/loading region data
      - Added DumpRegionStore() function to dump all region properties: production cuts,
        volumes list and material list
      - Increased the default number of iterations in TG4RegionsManager::DefineRegions
        to 5 (was 2)
      - Improved CheckRegions() and changed the default value of the energy tolerance
        for checking regions to 0.01, aded a function/UI command to set this value
      - New UI commands:
        /mcRegions/save [true|false]
        /mcRegions/load [true|false]
        /mcRegions/setFileName fileName
        /mcRegions/setEnergyTolerance value
        /mcRegions/fromG4Table [true|false]

    Fixes:
    Geant4 VMC:
    - In TG4RegionsManager::DefineRegions: skip evaluation of cuts when the production cuts
      are already defined (this significantly speeds up the procedure)
    - Fixed iteration limits in TG4RegionsManager::Iterate() - do not skip the last bin

    Tested with VMC 2.0, Geant4 11.1.p1 (with embedded CLHEP 2.4.6.2)
      Root 6.28/00, VGM 5.1, Garfield 4.0

  18/01/2023
  v6-2:
    Geant4 VMC:
    - Migration to Geant4 11.1:
      - Added support for G4NeutronGeneralProcess
      - Added handling of CoatedDielectric* optical boundary processes
        (new in Geant4 11.1)
      - Explicitly set CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD from Geant4 setting
    - Added "hyperNuclei" option to the extra physics constructor (#37)
      (This allows to activate hyper-nuclei processes at the physics list
      constructor.)

    G4Root:
    - Faster TGeo<->G4 geometry lookups (#40)
      (Thanks to S. Wenzel, CERN)
      - Change of type map --> unordered_map for the G4 <-> TGeo
        translation.
        This is advantageous since the structures are read-only (random key access)
        and so we go from O(log(N)) to O(1) scaling on average.
        In tests for the ALICE detector, pp events, this commit results
        in a noticable speed increase (~5%) in the overall G4 runtime.

    Examples:
    - Use ROOT::EnableThreadSafety() in examples and test programs (#41)
      instead of the usage of TThread (now obsolete)

    Fixes:
    Geant4 VMC:
    - Fix in applying cuts - apply productions cuts only in the first step
    - Added support for G4GammaGeneralProcess:
      When new general gamma process is active (default in Geant4 11),
      the gamma produced secondaries creator process needs to be updated
      in the user application.
      (Code provided by M. Novak)

    Examples:
    - Make examples test suites working on macOS Monterey with SIP enabled

    Tested with VMC 2.0, Geant4 11.1 (with embedded CLHEP 2.4.6.2)
      Root 6.24/10, VGM 5.1, Garfield 4.0

  17/03/2022
  v6-1:
    Geant4 VMC:
    - Replaced usage of G4 process names with process sub type codes (#31):
      - Added new TMCProcessMap and TMCProcessMapPhysics classes and removed
        TG4ProcessControlMap, TG4ProcessMCMap and corresponding physics constructor
        classes
      - Improved TG4G3CutVector - added data to save information
        if the extra BCUT*/DCUT* are different from CUTGAM/ELE
        and if the *CUTM and *CUTE differ; this allows to skip
        additional evaluation of creator process/particle type
        when not needed

    All packages:
    - Added GitHub action for Doxygen deployment

    Fixes:
    Geant4 VMC:

    - Fixes in applying cuts and processes maps: (#29)
      - Fixed mapping of some hadronic processes
      - Fixed applying PPCUTM:
        Using G4Step::GetSecondaryInCurrentStep() instead of GetSecondary(),
        as the second one provides accumulated secondaries since the first step
    - CMake: Fix G4Root_BUILD_TEST option in main CMakeLists. (#28)
      (thanks to Oliver Freyermuth (Physics Institute of the University of Bonn))
    - Fixed locking in TG4ModelConfigurationManager (#23)

    - Upgraded license to GPL 3.0

    Geant4 VMC:
    - Implemented Multiple-engine usage: with this update GEANT4_VMC becomes capable
      of running together with other engines sharing the simulation of one event.
    - Implemented special biasing that allows to activate INCLXX hadronic model in selected media.
    - Improved commands for setting special physics models:
      - Added "setOneRegion" command to supports names with spaces
      - Added support for abc* pattern
      For example:
      /mcPhysics/biasing/setRegions ITS*
         # set biasing to all media starting with ITS
      /mcPhysics/biasing/setOneRegion ITS_SPD-BUS CU KAPTON$

     - Code clean-up in TG4MagneticField
     - Fixed deleting objects in TG4Field
    - Take into account new TVirtualMCApplication::EndOfEvent(), called by MC at the end of
      event before SD's end of event
    - Implemented TGeant4::ProcessEvent() and added TGeant4::FinishEvent()
      This allows event-by-event processing in TGeant4. The FinishEvent() function has to be called by the user after all events have been processed.
    - Added a new command
      /mcPrimaryGenerator/skipUnknownParticles true|false:
      it permits to skip unknown particles (not defined in Geant4) instead of aborting the execution with an exception
    - Simplified TG4Verbose class

    Examples:

      --examples, --debug, --cmp-ref

    Fixes:
    Geant4 VMC:
    - Fixes in applying cuts:
      - Do not let neutron decay if it is stopped with a specialCut and has assigned the neutron
        killer process.
      - Removed special cut processes which never apply a cut (ForEplus, ForOther).
    - Removed creating Root UI at initialisation :
      this should hopefully fix the break when running in batch mode without GUI observed in ALICE tests on MAC OSX
    - Fixed resetting the primary particles ids
      (thanks to B. Volkel (CERN) for reporting this problems)
    - Fixed stopping a track if called from MCApplication::PreTrack()
      (thanks to B. Volkel, CERN, for reporting this problem)
    - Allow compiling with non Apple Clang on macOS

    G4Root
    - OpNovice: Use "UseGeant4" instead of ${Geant4_USE_FILE}
      (thanks to Oliver Freyermuth (Physics Institute of the University of Bonn))

    Examples:
    - Test suites:
      - Add missing "export" of LD_LIBRARY_PATH in test_suite.sh
      - Use correct path to executables for E03 sub-examples
      (thanks to Oliver Freyermuth (Physics Institute of the University of Bonn))
    - E03:
      - Fixed cut values: Applied the low limit 10keV (the minimal value accepted by Geant3)
      - Fixed generation of dictionary map files
    - ExGarfield: Fixed G3 macros
    - Monopole: Fixed failure when built with Geant4 MT

    Tested with VMC 1.0 (*), Geant4 10.5.p01 (with embedded CLHEP  2.4.1.0)
      Root 6.18/04 (*), VGM 4.6, Garfield master at c5efc3e352101b59e

  (*) VMC 1.0 is ahead of the vmc in ROOT 6.18/04,
  it includes fixes scheduled for the next ROOT tags 6.18/06 and 6.20/00.
  For this reason, the new multiple engine mode works correctly only with the
  VMC stand-alone or with vmc in ROOT master or v6-18-patches or v6-20-patches.

  18/12/2018
  v4-0:
    All packages:
    - Migration to Geant4 10.5
    - Stopped support for Root 5.x version.

    Geant4 VMC:
    - Added support for user defined sensitive detectors and new TVirtualMC…::NIELEdep():
      - Implemented new functions in TVirtualMC:
          void SetSensitiveDetector(const TString &volName, TVirtualMCSensitiveDetector *sd);
          TVirtualMCSensitiveDetector *GetSensitiveDetector(const TString &volName) const;
          void SetExclusiveSDScoring(Bool_t exclusiveSDScoring);
          TVirtualMC::NIELEdep() function
      - Added new UI commands:
          /mcDet/setExclusiveSDScoring true|false
          /mcDet/printUserSDs
    - Updated field classes for changes in Geant4 10.5:
      - Added new TG4Field base class for magnetic, electromagnetic and gravity
        fields which strength is defined via TVirtualMagField.
      - Added new commands to select a field type and activate monopole field:
        /mcMagField/fieldType fieldType
            fieldType = Magnetic | ElectroMagnetic | Gravity
        /mcMagField/setIsMonopole true|false
    - Added monopole physics classes extracted from the Geant4 monopole
      example in a new sub-category, physics_monopole
    - Added TG4RunConfiguration::SetParameter(const TString& name, Double_t value)
      for setting special parameters which need to be set before creating TGeant4,
      actually used for monopole properties:
      monopoleMass, monopoleElCharge, monopoleMagCharge
    - Allow to proceed empty events:
      In TG4PrimaryGeneratorAction: issue just a warning (instead of an exception)
      when there are no particles to be tracked.
      (Requested by ALICE)
    - Added a new command to (in)activate special stacking mechanism:
      /mcTracking/waitPrimary true|false
      (The command is available only when the special stacking action is activated
      in TG4RunConfiguration constructor (in g4Config.C))

    MTRoot:
    - Merged classes in a single TMCRootManager class and removed locking of
      Root IO operations except for creating and deleting Root files.

    Examples:
    - Splitting E03 in two options:
       E03a - scoring via sensitive volumes and MCApplication::Stepping (old way)
       E03b - scoring via sensitive detectors derived from new TVirtualMCSensitiveDetector
              interface
    - Added Monopole example (working only with Geant4)

    Fixes:
    Geant4 VMC:
      - Fixed creating regions with special physics via the command:
        /mcPhysics/emModel/setRegions regionName
        It was failing when the medium name was associated with a material
        with a different name.
      - Process the extra boundary step only for alive tracks.
        (Thanks to Benedikt Volkel for pointing at this inconsistency.)
      - Fixes in application of VMC cuts:
        the DCUTE, DCUTM, BCUTE, BCUTM cuts are applied only in the track first step
        what emulates a production cut
        (This fixes the problem reported by ALICE, JIRA ALIROOT-7121)
      - Fix in implementation of TVirtualMC::VolName(Int_t volId)
        (Thank to A. Morsch, CERN for reporting the problem.)
      - Fix in CMake:
        Comparing the ROOT version with LESS instead of LESS_EQUAL, as it is not available
        in CMake minimum version declared
      - Fix for excluding TMCAutoLock in MTRoot installation.
        TMCAutoLock was excluded from the library but TMCAutoLock.h was still present in
        the installed include

    Tested with Geant4 10.05 (with embedded CLHEP  2.4.1.0)
      Root 6.14/06, VGM 4.4, Garfield master at 07c0ec50a0d3086b3 (*)

  v3-6:
    All packages:
    - Migration to Geant4 10.4

    Geant4 VMC:
    - Improved VGM messenger: the VGM objects are created only when processing a
      command. (This prevents from creating an empty ROOT geometry named VGM which
      name may then persist in a user real geometry.)

    Tested with Geant4 10.04 (with embedded CLHEP 2.4.0.0)
      Root 6.12/04 and 5.34/36, VGM 4.4, Garfield v1.0

    - Implemented new TVirtualMC functions TrackPosition|Momentum(Float_t& ...)
    - Added calls to new TVirtualMCApplication non-const functions for MT
    - Let execute at rest processes when stopping a particle via user tracking cut:
      this makes the behavior as in Geant3

      (this feature is switched off by default since this version):
      /mcPhysics/skipExtDecayerNeutrino true|false
    - Take into account tracking medium parameter 'ifield = 0':
      - Set zero magnetic field to logical volumes assoiciated with tracking medium
        with 'ifield = 0' if global magnetic field is defined.
      - The feature must be activated with a new command:
        /mcDet/setIsZeroMagField true
    - Added new command for setting gamma to muons cross section factor:
      /mcPhysics/setGammaToMuonsCrossSectionFactor  value

    MTRoot
    - Do not include TMCAutoLock in MTRoot installation since Root version 6.08/06;
      the class was moved in Root since this version

    All packages:
    - Fixes in CMake build:
      - Handle also a case when -std flag is not defined in root-config --cflags
      - Do not override CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR (thanks to Dennis Klein, GSI)
      - Add support for ROOT compiled with C++14 (thanks to Dario Berzano, CERN)
    Geant4 VMC:
    - Fixed implementations  for performance optimization applied in 3.4:
      - Do not cache pointer to stepping action as this made calls to VMC functions
        inavailable in initialization.
      - Added new function TG4RunManager::CacheMCStack() called from
        TG4PrimaryGeneratorAction::GeneratePrimaries so that the stack can
        be defined by the user up to MCApplication::BeginEvent at latest
    - Do not skip neutrinos in TG4ExtDecayer by default;
      (requirement from Thomas Ruf, ShipSoft)
    - Added AnnihiToMuPair, ee2hadr, GammaToMuPair processes in the VMC process maps
      which were missing
    Examples:
    - Exclude ExGarfield from compilation and tests with Root 6
      (as Garfield++ requires Root 5x)

    Tested with Geant4 10.03.p03 (with embedded CLHEP   2.3.4.3.)
      Root 5.34/36, 6.11/02 and 6.10/08(*), VGM 4.4, Garfield v1.0

        - Added TG4TransitionRadiation physics builder, according to
          the Geant4 extended example TestEm10
        - Added new command to define a radiator:
          /mcDet/setRadiator ...
      - Implemented command to override the default G4 production cuts table energy range:
        - /mcPhysics/productionCutsTableEnergyRange
          (used in the Garfield example)

    Examples:
      - Added new examples:
        - Gflash - use of Geant4 GFlash fast simulation
        - Garfield - integration of Garfield++ using Geant4 fast simulation framework
        - TR - use of Geant4 transition radiation physics
      - All new examples use features of Geant4; when run with Geant3 the Geant3
        standard configuration & physics is used
      - The examples should be run in sequential mode.

    Fixes:
    Geant4 VMC:
      - Fix in TG4ParticlesManager::CreateDynamicParticle(TParticle*):
        the particle polarization was not propagated from TParticle to Geant4;
        this affected the particles added to tracking by the user via stackPopper
      - Fixed deleting TG4SpecialControlsV2 instance in MT mode
    Examples:
      - In E06: fixed in cloning MCApplication on workers

    Tested with Geant4 10.02 (with embedded CLHEP  2.3.1.1.)
      Root 5.34/34 and Root 6.06/00, VGM 4.3, Garfield v1.0

  17/08/2015
  v3-2:
    Geant4 VMC:
    - Added support for local magnetic fields.
    - Added cached magnetic field and a related UI command :
        /mcMagneticField/setConstDistance value unit
      The cached magnetic field is created automatically when
      the ConstDistance parameter is set to a non zero value.
    - Added a possibility to include a user defined magnetic field equation of motion
      and its integrator
    - Integrated a new special UrbanMsc model adapted for ALICE EMCAL by V. Ivantchenko
      and introduced a new set of commands (which do not allow invalid configurations):
        /mcPhysics/emModel/setEmModel modelName
        /mcPhysics/emModel/setParticles particleName1 particleName2 ...
        /mcPhysics/emModel/setRegions regionName1 regionName2 ...

    Examples:
    - E03: Added a test configuration for including a user defined magnetic field equation
           of motion and its integrator in example E03 and included the test in test suites
    - E06: Added test for adding tracks in VMC stack by user (in E06 example)
    - A01: Implemented option for use of local magnetic field and
           added a test with use of local fields in test suites

    Fixes:
    Geant4 VMC:
    - Fixed TG4StackPopper class handling adding particles on the stack
      from the user application. The user tracks generated at the last step of parent track
      were not popped to the stack.
    - Fixed implementation of TVirtualMC::IsTrackDisappeared():
      return false if fSuspend, true if fStopAndKill.
    - Use G4PAIPhotModel instead of G4PAIPhotonModel (recommended since Geant4 10.00)
    - Fixed the expected names of output-files from rootcint (required by CMake 3.2.x):
      - thanks to Oliver Freyermuth (Physics Institute of the University of Bonn).

    G4Root (A. Gheata):
      Fixed boundary crossing errors (by A. Gheata)
      -  This error was due to the G4 field propagator which was exiting
         some volume inside the mother and expecting a non-zero step, but in fact
         was entering a daughter volume right away.
      This fixes killing tracks by G4PropagatorInField as:
      *** G4Exception : GeomNav1002
              issued by : G4PropagatorInField::ComputeStep()
      Particle is stuck; it will be killed.
          Zero progress for 51 attempted steps.
          Proposed Step is 1.78471e-05 but Step Taken is 1.78471e-05
         in volume TPC_Drift

  14/12/2012
  v2-14:
    Migration to Geant4 9.6
    Geant4 VMC:
    Developments:
    - Implemented commands for activating saving random number status
      and restoring it from a file:

    - Added TG4RootNavigator::GetGlobalExitNormal(), required with Geant4 9.6.
      (A. Gheata)

    Fixes:
    - Fixed mapping between Rootino and geantino;
      user can now introduce chargedgeantino by setting the title
      "ChargedRootino" to Rootino particle.
    - Fixed bug in TVirtualMC::Gdtom() implementation
    - Fixed units in stacking particles

      instead of the local one
    - Fixes to support Geant4 native geometries: handling copyNo, taking into
      account the user limits
    - Fixed units in material optical properties

    Examples:

  v2-13:
    Migration to Geant4 9.5:
    In Makefiles: use of geant4-config if G4INSTALL is not defined

    Geant4 VMC:
    Developments:
    - Implemented a possibility to select sensitive volumes by the user;
      in this case TVirtualMCApplication::Stepping() function is called only when
      track is located in a sensitive volume.
    - Added the user physics selection in the TGeant4 title, so that
      it can be retrievable in a user application.
    - Migration to changes in G4PhysListFactory
      (now all hadronic lists can be combined with all EM options)
    - Modified building of physics list:
      Added TG4ExtraPhysicsList with the following optional Geant4 builders:
      G4ExtraPhysics   -  moved from TG4EmPhysicsList;
      G4OpticalPhysics -  which has replaced TG4OpticalPhysics;
        this implies the changes of commands for configuring optical processes
      G4RadioactiveDecayBuilder - new
    - Faster implementation of TVirtualMC::GetMediumID()
      (the medium ID is now added in TG4SensitiveDetector object)

    Fixes:
    - Fix in GetSecondary(..) (bug reported by L. Zambelli)
      there was missing conversion of units in the returned value of particle
      momentum.
    - Fixing compilation with G4UI_NONE and G4VIS_NONE

    Examples:
    - new g4libs.C macro with use of geant4-config;
      the macro based on liblist renamed to g4libs_old.C;
      previous g4libs_old.C (explicit loading) removed
    - E06:
      - Added setting parameters for Optical Mie Scattering (according N06)
      - Updated configuration optical processes using G4 commands
      - Removed special setting for G3 (it was causing G4 exception
        and seems not to be needed for G3)

    Tested with Geant4 9.5 (with embedded CLHEP 2.1.1.0),
      Root 5.30/04 and Root 5.32/00 + patch in root/etc from rev.42474,
      VGM 3.05

  14/07/2011
  v2-12:
    Migration to Root v5.30/00 and Geant4 9.5.b01

    Geant4 VMC:
    Developments:
    - Implemented new TVirtualMC functions:
      Bool_t GetMaterial(Int_t imat, ...);
      ... which replaced the current Gfmate(...) functions
    - Mapping physics processes from 9.4.p02
    - Adding light anti-ions (ani_deuteron, anti_triton, anti_alpha, anti_He3)
      so that users do not to define them themselves via
      TVirtualMC::DefineParticle.

    Fixes:
    - Coverity defects
    - Fix in TG4ParticlesManager for handling particles which have
      no equivalent in TDatabasePDG: the particle is now added in TDatabasePDG
      without issuing an exception

    Examples:
    - Adding a test for testing all available G4 physics lists
    - Adding a test for the new function GetMaterial() in E01
    - Removing code calling Geant3 visualization functions from all
      examples code and macros
    - Adding a primary generator with anti_nuclei in E03 and added this test
      in test_suite

  02/10/2010
  v2-10:
    Geant4 VMC:
    Improvements:
    - Implemented new TVirtualMC functions:
      virtual void   SetCollectTracks(...);
      virtual Bool_t IsCollectTracks() const;
      virtual Bool_t CurrentBoundaryNormal(...) const;
   - Added new TG4EmModelPhysics which allows user selection of an extra
      EM energy loss and fluctuations models.
   -  Adding a utility class, TG4ParticlesChecker, for comparing particles
      properties defined in Root and Geant4 and its messenger
      TG4ParticlesCheckerMessenger.
    - Implemented commands to allow user to customise the setting of the
      the max allowed step in materials with a density below a limit value
    - Added a possbility to switch off passing the random number seed from
      TRandom in CLHEP::HepRandom; this allows using standard Geant4 commands
      for saving and restoring the random number generator status
    - Mapped processed used in CHIPS and QBBC physics lists
    - Migration to Geant4 9.4.b01:
      - updated TG4UserParticlesPhysics, mapped processes present in new

    Fixes:
    - Fixed the time of flight returned via TVirtualMC::TrackPosition():
      return the global track time (= time since the event in which the track
      belongs is created) instead of local track time (= the local time since
      the current track is created) in order to be consistent with Geant3.

    Tested with Geant4 9.3.p02, CLHEP 2.0.4.5, Root 5.27/06, VGM 3.03
            and Geant4 9.4.b01, CLHEP 2.0.4.6

      - Moved from Root in Geant4 VMC

    Geant4 VMC:
    Improvements:
      - Added new class TG4FieldParameters which allows customization of Geant4
        magnetic field integrator and accuracy parameters.
        (See E02/g4config.in an example of new commands.)
      - Added new class TG4CrossSectionManager which allows inspecting
        hadronic cross sections.
        (See: http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/physics-list)
      - The available hadron physics lists names are now taken directly from
        G4PhysListFactory.

    Fixes:
      - In TG4RegionsManager:
        - set the range cuts to result always to an energy cut below the user
          cut value.
        - set ranges also for the world volume
        - increased the maximum order of search ranges (to 1km)
        - fixed CheckCut method (the cut from range must be <= VMC cut)
      - In TG4StepManager:
        - Adding its own G4Navigator object, which is used for LocateGlobalPoint...
          calls in pre-track phase.
          (Fixes the problem reported by A. Robert.)
      - In TG4OpGeometryManager, TG4OpticalPhysics
        - Do not set RINDEX material property if defined with zero values.
          (The zero value is a Geant3 convention to define material as metal
          which was not adopted in Geant4, where 0 values cause unpredictable
          behavior in G4OpBoundary process.)
        - The Raileigh and boundary processes were not added to opticalphoton
          process manager.
      - Fix in applying MCApplication::TrackingRMax,TrackingZMax.

    Examples:
      - Frozen testing examples with Fluka.

       - In optical physics:
         Implemented new command for user customization
         of optical physics list;
         Changed/added the default parameters:
           fgkDefaultMaxNumPhotons = 20;
           fgkDefaultMaxBetaChange = 1.0;
           fgkDefaultYieldFactor = 1.0;
       - Passing the random number seed from TRandom in CLHEP::HepRandom
         (on the request from FairRoot)
       - Added an option to print memory usage at the end of event
       - Added an option to print all regions
       - New, faster implementation of VMC functions:
           Int_t VolId(const Text_t* volName) const;
           const char* VolName(Int_t id) const;

    Fixes:
      - Fixes in applying VMC cuts:
        - fixed processes names in TG4G3CutVector
        - fix in applying PPCUTM: the cut is now applied as a limit
          to the total energy of e+e- pair procuced by muon;
          the cut is not applied for e+e- pair from gamma conversion
      - Fix in handling feedback photons: keep the feedback photon
          PDG encoding which is different from opticalphoton
      - Fix in applying max step limit
      - Fix in TG4RunConfiguration constructor:
          to handle correctly special physics options.
          Thanks to M. Al-Turany for reporting this problem.
      - Fixes for running with option G4UI_NONE
          Thanks to V. Di Benedetto for reporting this problem.
      - Fixed handling of particle weights
          Thanks to Vito Di Benedetto for pointing at this.

    Tested with Geant4 9.3, CLHEP 2.0.4.5, Root 5.26/00, VGM 3.02;

    Examples:
       - Added an example of magnetic field class Ex02MagField in E02

    Tested with Geant3 1.11, Geant4 VMC 2.8, Fluka VMC 0.4


  15/07/2009
  v2-7:
    Geant4 VMC:
      - Implemented new TVirtualMC function:
        virtual void SetUserParameters(Bool_t isUserParameters);
        which allows to activate the parameters defined in tracking media
        (DEEMAX, STMIN, STEMAX), which are, be default, ignored.
        In Geant4 case, only STEMAX is taken into account.
      - New implementation of VMC cuts via regions;
        this limits the number of secondaries produced beyond
        tracking cuts and speeds up simulation.
      - New implementation of support for special controls (G3 flags):
        The process TG4SpecialControls is replaced with a manager class
        TG4SpecialControlsV2, which functions are colled from tracking
        and stepping functions.
      - When using special stacking action, neutrinos are not killed
        by default, but optionally. This options can be set via a command:
        /mcTracking/skipNeutrino  [true|false]
       Fixes:
      - Fix in applying special controls (the original processes activation
        was not always restored when particle got out from a given tracking
        medium or stopped).
      - Fix in applying SetMaxStep (the original step limit was not always
        restored when particle got out from a given tracking
        medium or stopped).

     Tested with Geant4 9.2.p01, CLHEP 2.0.4.2, Root 5.24/00, VGM 3.02;

   Examples:
      - Fixes in E02 example: fixing a problem reported by A, Robert,
        when using stack for a large events, links to mother particles
        get lost after a few hundreds of events.

     Tested with Geant3 1.11, Geant4 VMC 2.7, Fluka VMC 0.4

       - Including the names of Root assemblies in volume names
         when exporting Root geometry in Geant4 (optinal)
       - Removing G4VisManager inheritance from TG4VisManager;
         G4VisExecutive is now used for instatiating G4 visualzation
         drivers
      Fixes:
