Introduction
=============
  To demonstrate use of VirtualMC, four Geant4 novice
  examples (N01, N02, N03, N06) has been rewritten
  as VMC applications.
  
  See more detail description in README files
  withing each example subdirectory. 


Geometry definition
====================

  The VirtualMC defines since beginning the methods for geometry 
  construction in Geant3 style (the functions have the same names and 
  the same parameters sequence as the functions in Geant3).
  This makes easier transition from Geant3 application to VMC.
  
  Since the integration of the TGeo geometry modeller,
  user has a possibility to define geometry directly via TGeo,
  with more user-friendly interfaces.

  All VMC examples define by default geometry via TGeo (since 
  Geant4 VMC version 2.0).
  The equivalent geometry definition via TVirtualMC 
  interface can be activated by setting the option "oldGeometry"
  to the MC application (via Ex0nMCApplication::SetOldGeometry(kTRUE)).

Macros for running examples
===========================

  In all examples there are provides macros:
  
  run_g3.C   - for running example with Geant3
  run_g4.C   - for running example with Geant4      

Configuration macros:
======================

  The selection of the concrete MC, geometry navigation
  and eventually other options is done in the configuration
  macros.
  Here is a list of configuration macros provided with
  the examples:
   
  g3Config.C      - for G3 with native geometry 
  g3tgeoConfig.C  - for G3 with TGeo geometry (default)

  g4Config.C      - for G4 with native geometry navigation (default)
  g4tgeoConfig.C  - for G4 with TGeo geometry navigation
  xyzOld.C        - the same as obove but for geometry defined via VMC 

  g4config.in  - macro for G4 configuration using G4 commands
  g4vis.in     - macro for G4 visualization settings

To run example:
===============
  
  With G3 + TGeo:
  root[0] .x run_g3.C  
  
  With G4:
  root[0] .x run_g4.C  
  
  With G4 + TGeo navigation:
  root[0] .x run_g4.C("g4tgeoConfig.C"); 
  
Test macros:
============

  To test all possible configurations, there is provided a test
  macro for each examples

  test_En.C(const TString& configMacro, Bool_t oldGeometry)
     
  with parameters:
     - configMacro: configuration macro loaded in initialization 
     - oldGeometry: if true - geometry is defined via VMC, otherwise via TGeo
     
  The tests with all configurations can be run within
  the test suite:

  test_suite.sh
  
  which saves all test outputs in the files which names correspond
  to run configuration:
    test_g3_tgeo_tgeo.out - G3, geometry defined via TGeo, TGeo navigation
    test_g3_vmc_nat.out   - G3, geometry defined via VMC,  G3 native navigation
    test_g3_vmc_tgeo.out  - G3, geometry defined via VMC,  TGeo navigation
    test_g4_tgeo_nat.out  - G4, geometry defined via TGeo, G4 native navigation
    test_g4_tgeo_tgeo.out - G4, geometry defined via TGeo, TGeo navigation
    test_g4_vmc_nat.out   - G4, geometry defined via VMC,  G4 native navigation
    test_g4_vmc_tgeo.out  - G4, geometry defined via VMC,  TGeo navigation

  The files are saved in log/E0n directory.
  The reference output files, which are updated with each release,
  can be found at log_ref directory.  
   
  All run_*.C macros can be run via run suite script:

  run_suite.sh
  
  which saves all output in run_*.out files.
