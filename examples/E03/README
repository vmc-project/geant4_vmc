Example03
=========
  Geant4 ExampleN03 adapted to Virtual Monte Carlo
  and extended for testing some other VMC features.
  Since Geant4 VMC v3.7, the example is provided in two variants:
  - E03a - scoring via sensitive volumes and MCApplication::Stepping
           (old way)
  - E03b - scoring via sensitive detectors derived from new
           TVirtualMCSensitiveDetector interface

  Demonstrates:
    Geometry - divided volume (Gsdvn)
    Definition of sensitive volumes
    Definition of VMC sensitive detectors (new since v3.7)
    Physics - hadronics processes off
    Particles cuts 
      - G4 cut in range: 1mm
        G3 cuts set to correspond to 1mm cut in range
    Primary generator with randomized position (optional)
      defined number of electrons with moving position and fixed direction
    Calorimetry hits
    Storing hits, particles stack in Root file
    Drawing geometry (G3, G3+TGeo, G4) + trajectories (G3+TGeo and G4)
    Verbosity
    Geometry defined via Geant4 (G4)
    User defined physics list (G4)
      (Use of user own defined physics list is demonstrated on
       the LHEP_BERT hadronics physics list provided in Geant4.)
    User defined particles and ions (G3, G4)
    User defined regions (G4)
    User defined magnetic field equation of motion and/or its integrator (G4)

To run example (Ex03a)
======================
  
  With G3 + TGeo:
  root[0] .x load_g3a.C 
  root[1] .x run_g3.C

  With G4:
  root[0] .x load_g4a.C 
  root[1] .x run_g4.C

  With G4 + TGeo navigation:
  root[0] .x load_g4a.C
  root[1] .x run_g4.C("g4tgeoConfig.C");

  With G4 with geometry defined via Geant4:
  root[0] .x load_g4a.C
  root[1] .x run_g4.C("g4Config1.C");

  With G4 with user defined physics list:
  root[0] .x load_g4a.C
  root[1] .x run_g4.C("g4Config2.C");

  With G4 with user defined regions:
  root[1] .x run_g4.C("g4Config3.C");

  With G4 + TGeo navigation with user defined regions:
  root[0] .x load_g4a.C
  root[0] .x run_g4.C("g4tgeoConfig3.C");

  To run the Ex03b variant, use load_g3b.C and load_g4b.C macros.
